# Compute which roles are affected by the current branch's diff against
# `origin/main`, expanded transitively over run_after + dependencies +
# services edges via cli.meta.applications.resolution.affected.
#
# Output (single line on stdout):
#   __ALL__                          full deploy needed. Emitted when:
#                                      * the diff is empty, OR
#                                      * any changed path lives outside
#                                        roles/<role>/, OR
#                                      * any seed role is non-modellable
#                                        in the reverse resolver
#                                        (resolver exit 2), OR
#                                      * the resolver itself errors out
#                                        (any other non-zero exit).
#   <role-id> [<role-id> ...]        restricted deploy set (whitelist).
#
# Pre-conditions:
#   - The container started by `make up` is running (the Python resolver
#     is invoked via `docker compose ... exec infinito`, identical to the
#     pattern used in scripts/meta/resolve/apps.sh).
#   - `git fetch origin main` is reachable (caller already did checkout).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 in all defined output cases (including the fail-safe __ALL__).
#   The script is fail-safe by design: any resolver failure widens the
#   deploy matrix to "all", it never narrows it.
