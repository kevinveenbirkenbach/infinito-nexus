# 🌐 DNS Setup Scripts

This directory contains platform-specific scripts for setting up local DNS resolution for the `infinito.example` domain (and subdomains) on the development machine.

All scripts map `*.infinito.example` → `127.0.0.1` so that local deployments are reachable via their expected hostnames.

## 📄 Scripts

### 🐧 `linux.sh`

General-purpose DNS setup for Linux systems. Supports multiple strategies depending on the environment:

- **NetworkManager + dnsmasq** — preferred path when NetworkManager is active; configures the NM dnsmasq plugin with a wildcard zone entry.
- **System dnsmasq** — fallback when NetworkManager is not running; configures a standalone dnsmasq service.
- **`/etc/hosts` fallback** — used in non-systemd environments (e.g. Docker containers, LXC) where service management is unavailable; writes a managed block of host entries directly into the hosts file.

Shared helper functions are sourced from [`../common.sh`](../common.sh).

### 🪟 `wsl.sh`

WSL2-specific DNS setup. Only executes when running inside a WSL2 environment (detected via `/proc/version`). Configures:

- **dnsmasq** with the discovered WSL2 upstream DNS gateway as forwarder.
- **systemd-resolved** stub listener disabled to avoid port conflicts.
- **`/etc/resolv.conf`** pointed at the local dnsmasq instance (`127.0.0.1`).
- **`/etc/wsl.conf`** set to `generateResolvConf=false` to prevent WSL from overwriting the resolver config on restart.
