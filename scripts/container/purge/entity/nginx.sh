#!/usr/bin/env bash
# nginx vhost purge for stacks (entity-keyed).
#
# Removes the per-domain vhost files belonging to every app under each
# given compose entity. Driven by the app-keyed orchestrator
# `purge/apps.sh` as a sibling of `db.sh`, `compose.sh`, `dir.sh` — a
# stack that drops out of a matrix-deploy round would otherwise leave
# stale vhosts behind and the next round's HTTPS probe would see HTTP
# 502 (nginx still serves the vhost but the container was pruned)
# instead of the expected TLS-error 000.
#
# All resolution and filesystem work lives in
# `utils.cleanup.nginx_vhosts` so the bash side stays a thin wrapper.
#
# Usage:
#   ./purge/entity/nginx.sh <STACK1> [STACK2] [...]
#
# Env:
#   NGINX_DIR  Base nginx config dir inside the container.
#              Default: /etc/nginx (matches svc-prx-openresty/meta/volumes.yml).
#   DOMAIN              DOMAIN_PRIMARY used to render Jinja in roles/<role>/meta/server.yml.
#              Default: infinito.example.
