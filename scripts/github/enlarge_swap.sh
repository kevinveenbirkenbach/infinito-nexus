# Enlarge host swap on a GitHub-hosted runner. Replaces the runner's
# default ~4 GB swap with a fixed-size swapfile so transient memory
# spikes (e.g. peertube plugin install, issue #162) don't trip the host
# OOM-killer, WITHOUT starving the rest of the job of disk space.
#
# Prefers /mnt when it is a separate partition (classic ubuntu-latest
# layout with /dev/sdb mounted at /mnt). On current public runners
# there is no separate /mnt partition — everything lives on /, so we
# place the swapfile there. The swap size is a hard constant, never a
# "free minus buffer" computation: a previous version consumed ~99 GB
# on a 145 GB root, leaving so little headroom that later Docker layer
# writes (Playwright test image pull) failed with ENOSPC. See #162.
#
# Usage: enlarge_swap.sh [size-gb]
# Default: 16 GB (empirically sufficient for the peertube spike).
#
# Debug toggle: set SKIP_SWAP=1 to leave the runner's default swap
# untouched (A/B probe for issues caused by this script itself).
