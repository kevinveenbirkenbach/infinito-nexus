"""
Resolve the set of roles affected by a change to a given set of seed roles.

A role R is "affected" by seed S iff S appears in R's transitive prerequisite
closure (run_after + dependencies + services), as defined by
:class:`cli.meta.applications.resolution.combined.resolver.CombinedResolver`.

Usage:
  python -m cli.meta.applications.resolution.affected --changed-roles ROLE [ROLE ...]

Output:
  Whitespace-separated, sorted list of affected role names (single line),
  including the seed roles themselves.

Exit codes:
  0  Success. The closure was computed and printed.
  1  Resolver error or unknown seed.
  2  At least one seed role is non-modellable in the resolver
     (no application_id and not referenced by any role's run_after).
     Callers MUST treat this as "fall back to a full deploy" because
     the resolver cannot guarantee that downstream consumers are
     enumerated for that seed.
