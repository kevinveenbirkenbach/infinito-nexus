"""Default (non-variant) include resolution for the matrix planner.

When NO primary app ships a `meta/variants.yml`, the planner falls back
to this path — the `CombinedResolver` walks both `run_after` and
`shared:`-edges in the variant-merged services map and Jinja flags are
evaluated at deploy time against `group_names`. This module owns the
two helpers that path needs and nothing else; the variant-only path
lives in `.variants`.
