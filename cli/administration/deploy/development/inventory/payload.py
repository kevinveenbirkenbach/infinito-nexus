"""Variant payload baking for the development inventory.

Two helpers, both pure: `_resolve_variant_payloads` picks the variant
payload for each app in a round's include set, and `_bake_overrides`
merges those payloads under `applications:` inside the `--vars` JSON
the inventory provision step consumes. Caller-supplied `extra_vars`
always win over the variant bake — that's the documented "user vars
always win" rule.
