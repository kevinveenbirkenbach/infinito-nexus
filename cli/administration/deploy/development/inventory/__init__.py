"""SPOT for development inventory creation.

Anything that wants to materialise the development inventory MUST go
through :func:`build_dev_inventory` (single folder) or
:func:`build_dev_inventory_matrix` (one folder per matrix-deploy round).
Both flow through :class:`DevInventorySpec` and own:

* the SPOT vars-file (``DEV_INVENTORY_VARS_FILE``),
* per-app variant baking (each role's ``meta/variants.yml`` is resolved
  at build time and emitted as ``applications.<app>`` overrides into
  the inventory's ``host_vars``, with variant 0 as the fallback for
  every role that is not a primary in the current matrix round),
* the vault password file.

The deploy wrapper consumes :func:`plan_dev_inventory_matrix` to know
which folder to deploy against in each round; the planner is a pure
function so wrapper and init step compute the same plan independently.

Internal layout (one module per responsibility):

* :mod:`.spec`            — :class:`DevInventorySpec` + ``PlanEntry`` type
* :mod:`.payload`         — variant payload pick + ``--vars`` bake
* :mod:`.legacy_resolver` — ``CombinedResolver``-driven include resolution
* :mod:`.planner`         — :func:`plan_dev_inventory_matrix`
* :mod:`.builder`         — :func:`build_dev_inventory` + matrix orchestrator

The private helpers (``_resolve_round_include`` and friends) are
re-exported below because unit tests historically patch them under this
package path. New tests SHOULD patch the submodule path directly
(e.g. ``inventory.legacy_resolver._resolve_round_include``).
