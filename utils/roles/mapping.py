"""Role mapping SPOT.

This module is the single source of truth for role-level dependencies:
the paths inside a role directory, the role types each path may
legitimately appear under, the mandatory shape of those paths, and the
``marker`` entries that drive role-type detection itself. Both lint
tests and the role-type predicate live downstream of this file:

* lint tests import :data:`ROLE_FILES` to forbid type-scoped artefacts
  on the wrong role type, to assert that mandatory files are present,
  and to assert that mandatory dotted-path entries inside those files
  exist;
* the role-type predicate lives in :mod:`utils.roles.type` (see
  :func:`utils.roles.type.get_role_type`) and walks the ``marker``
  flag in this file's ``entries`` to derive a role's type from the
  values declared in its own files.

Path constants
--------------

Every ``ROLE_FILE_*`` constant carries the file's path relative to the
role directory itself (``roles/<role-name>/``). Callers compose the
absolute path by joining with the resolved role directory::

    from utils.roles.mapping import ROLE_FILE_META_SERVICES

    services_path = (
        PROJECT_ROOT / "roles" / "web-app-matomo" / ROLE_FILE_META_SERVICES
    )

Type vocabulary and shape
-------------------------

``ROLE_TYPE_*`` constants name the role categories the project
distinguishes. Each ``ROLE_FILES[<path>]['types']`` value is a list of
type-scoping entries with the shape::

    {
        "type":      <ROLE_TYPE_*>,
        "mandatory": <bool>,                # MUST the file/entry be set
        "allowed":   <bool>,                # MAY the file/entry be set
        "entries": [                        # dotted-path facts about the file
            {
                "path":      "application_id",
                "mandatory": True,
                "allowed":   True,
                "marker":    True,          # the role IS this type when set
            },
            {
                "path":      "ports.local.http",
                "mandatory": False,
                "allowed":   True,
            },
        ],
    }

Two complementary flags control the per-type policy:

* ``mandatory`` (default ``False``) — the file (or dotted-path entry)
  MUST be present and non-empty for a role of this type. Implies
  ``allowed: True``; setting ``mandatory: True`` together with
  ``allowed: False`` is a schema error.
* ``allowed`` (default ``True``) — the file (or dotted-path entry)
  MAY be present for a role of this type. Set ``allowed: False`` to
  forbid the file/entry on roles of this type so the lint layer can
  surface the offence with a precise reason.

Roles whose type set does not match any explicit entry inherit the
type's policy from the wildcard fallback (see below); without a
wildcard the file/entry is implicitly forbidden.

``entries`` is a list of dotted-path facts about the file's content.
Each entry carries the same ``mandatory`` and ``allowed`` semantics
described above and adds a ``marker`` flag (default ``False``):
``marker: True`` declares the path as the type marker for the
surrounding type entry. :func:`utils.roles.type.get_role_types` walks
every ``marker: True`` entry; each marker that resolves to a non-empty
value in the role's file adds the surrounding type to the role's type
set. ``application_id`` for ``application`` and ``system_service_id``
for ``system-service`` are the canonical markers.

Wildcard ``ROLE_TYPE_ALL`` collapses repetition: a single entry with
``"type": ROLE_TYPE_ALL`` applies to every concrete role type. A
concrete-type entry that appears alongside the wildcard MUST take
precedence so a contributor can spell out one per-type exception
without losing the shared default.
