"""In-process YAML loader with per-path memoisation.

Many CLI tools walk the same `roles/<role>/<config|vars|meta>/...yml`
files multiple times during a single invocation (dependency resolution,
service resolution, role introspection, ...). Each direct
`yaml.safe_load(path.read_text())` re-parses YAML and re-touches disk.

This module exposes a single cached `load_yaml(path)` so each absolute
path is parsed at most once per Python process. `dump_yaml` writes
through and evicts the cached entry. `invalidate(path)` is the explicit
escape hatch when a caller knows a file was changed externally.

CACHE SEMANTICS
- Cache key: `(str(Path(path).resolve()), st_mtime_ns, st_size)`.
  Symlinks resolve once at the cache boundary so the same target shares
  an entry regardless of how callers spell the path. The mtime+size
  signature invalidates entries whenever the file is rewritten by an
  external process (e.g. Ansible's `copy:` module persisting tokens
  while the same Python process keeps running across many calls).
- Cached value: the **list of documents** ``yaml.safe_load_all`` returns
  for that file. Single-document YAML files cache as a 1-element list,
  so a callsite that asks for the single doc (``load_yaml`` /
  ``load_yaml_any``) and a callsite that asks for the multi-doc list
  (``load_yaml_all``) share **the same parse**. The same list / dict
  instances are returned to every caller, so callers that mutate the
  result MUST `copy.deepcopy()` it first. Treat the value as read-only.
- Lifetime: process-wide. CLI tools that never rewrite their inputs see
  the same hit rate as before; long-lived Ansible processes pick up
  out-of-band writes on the very next read.
