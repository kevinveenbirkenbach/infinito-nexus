# Package-Cache Frontend (TLS-terminating reverse proxy) 🔐

TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front of the Sonatype Nexus 3 OSS [`package-cache`](../package-cache/README.md) service. Owns the real upstream package-manager hostnames via DNS-hijack so clients reach the cache transparently.

For services, activation, coverage, and operations of the local cache stack, see [cache.md](../../docs/contributing/environment/cache.md).

## Files 📄
