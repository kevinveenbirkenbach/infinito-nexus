"""
Integration test: ensure no Jinja variables are used in handler *names*.

Why this policy?
- Handler identifiers should be stable strings. If you ever notify by handler
  name (instead of a dedicated `listen:` key), a templated name can fail to
  resolve or silently not match what `notify` referenced.
- Even when `listen:` is used (recommended), variable-laden names make logs and
  tooling brittle and can trigger undefined-variable errors at parse/run time.
- Keeping handler names static improves reliability, debuggability, and
  compatibility with analysis tools.

Allowed:
- You may still template other fields or use `listen:` for dynamic trigger
  routing; just keep the handlerâ€™s `name` static text.
