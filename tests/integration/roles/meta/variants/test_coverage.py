"""Integration guard: every ``services.yml`` flag that resolves via
the dynamic ``"{{ '<role>' in group_names }}"`` form MUST be exercised
by ``meta/variants.yml`` — at least one variant entry pinning the
flag to literal ``true``, AND at least one pinning it to literal
``false``.

Rationale
---------

The matrix-deploy CLI iterates the per-role variant list (see
``docs/contributing/artefact/files/role/variants.md``) and produces
one inventory folder per entry. A flag declared as dynamic in
``services.yml`` only takes its boolean shape once the inventory
templar resolves it against the host's ``group_names``. Without
explicit variant overrides on both sides, the matrix only ever
exercises one branch — the role can ship for years with the
``false`` (or ``true``) path effectively dead.

This test makes that coverage explicit: the role's own
``meta/variants.yml`` MUST contain, for each dynamic
``(service_key, flag)`` pair, at least one variant overriding the
flag to ``true`` and one overriding it to ``false``. Pairs may share
variants — a single entry may pin multiple unrelated services true
while pinning others false; the test only checks that the union of
all variants covers both polarities for every dynamic flag.

For databases the same rule reduces to coverage of ``shared``: the
DB-consumer ``enabled`` flag stays literal ``true`` (with
``# nocheck: dynamic-flag``), so only ``shared`` is dynamic and needs
the two-polarity coverage.
