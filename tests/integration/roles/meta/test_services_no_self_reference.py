"""Integration guard: a role's own primary entity in
``meta/services.yml`` MUST NOT use the dynamic
``"{{ '<own-role-name>' in group_names }}"`` form for its
``enabled`` / ``shared`` flags. Both MUST be literal ``true``.

Rationale
---------

The role's own ``meta/services.yml`` is only loaded when the role
itself is being included — which by definition means the role IS in
the live host's ``group_names``. Asking ``'<own-role>' in group_names``
inside the role's own primary entity is therefore tautological: the
expression ALWAYS evaluates to ``true`` whenever it gets evaluated at
all. Pinning both flags to literal ``true`` avoids the dead branch
and keeps the meaning explicit ("this role is the provider; that fact
is static, not group-conditional").

For consumer references (``services.<other-key>`` in some other
role's services.yml), the dynamic form is the right shape — it
expresses "co-deploy provider X iff X is on this host". This rule
applies only to the role's own primary entity.
