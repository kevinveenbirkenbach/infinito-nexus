"""Lint that every env key referenced by ``roles/<role>/files/playwright/playwright.spec.js``
is declared in the sibling ``roles/<role>/templates/playwright.env.j2``.

Counterpart to ``test_env_keys_used.py``: that one catches *dead*
declarations (env declared, spec never reads); this one catches *missing*
declarations (spec reads, env never declares) — the failure mode that
slipped through with ``DASHBOARD_BASE_URL`` on ``web-app-kix`` and made
every persona test crash on the preamble assertion.

Excluded from the check:

* Names matched by ``_RUNTIME_ENV_NAMES`` — Node.js / Playwright /
  test-runner / CI-injected variables that originate outside the
  rendered ``.env`` and would NEVER belong in a role template.
* Names matched by ``_SHARED_HELPER_PREFIXES`` — keys consumed only
  by the shared helpers under ``roles/test-e2e-playwright/files/``
  (e.g. ``PLAYWRIGHT_*`` runtime knobs) and rendered at deploy time
  by the test-e2e-playwright role itself, not the per-app templates.
