"""Forbid ad-hoc docker-network creation outside the central utils.

Every role that needs a docker network MUST go through one of two
canonical helpers, both under
``roles/sys-svc-compose/tasks/utils/network/``:

  1. ``create.yml`` -- network-only, no compose-up.
     Use when the role still needs to do work between the network
     creation and the compose-up (e.g. copy entrypoint/healthcheck
     files into the instance dir, render extra configs, pre-attach
     other resources). Also the right choice when pre-creating
     multiple foreign networks in a loop (prometheus's
     ``native_metrics_apps`` pre-create), where re-flushing
     sys-svc-compose per iteration would be wrong.

  2. ``routine.yml`` -- wrapper that loads the docker-python deps,
     calls ``create.yml`` for the role's own network, and then
     immediately re-includes ``sys-svc-compose`` with
     ``docker_compose_flush_handlers: true`` to fire compose-up.
     Use when the role is a self-contained single-container service
     whose only pre-condition for compose-up is its own network
     (mariadb, postgres, ollama).

Both helpers derive the docker-side network name from
``role_id | get_entity_name`` and the subnet from
``meta/server.yml.networks.local.subnet``, so the mapping stays in one
place. Ad-hoc ``community.docker.docker_network`` calls or shell-out
to ``docker network create`` / ``container network create`` reintroduce
the drift the utils were extracted to prevent.

Allowed (by path): only ``create.yml`` itself; the wrapper
``routine.yml`` already delegates to it via ``include_tasks``.

Detected antipatterns:
  - ``community.docker.docker_network:`` (the underlying Ansible module)
  - ``docker_network:`` (short / collection-less alias)
  - ``docker network create`` / ``container network create`` inside any
    shell, command, or run body

        Two entry points exist; pick the one that matches the role's

        1. ``create.yml`` -- network-only, no compose-up.
           Use when the role does extra setup between the network
           creation and the compose-up (asset copies, configs, ...),

        2. ``routine.yml`` -- wrapper that includes
           ``create.yml`` AND immediately re-flushes
           ``sys-svc-compose`` so the role's compose-up runs right
           after. Use for self-contained single-container services
           (mariadb / postgres / ollama)::

               - include_tasks: "{{ [playbook_dir, 'roles/sys-svc-compose/tasks/utils/network/routine.yml'] | path_join }}"

        Both derive name (``role_id | get_entity_name``) and subnet
        (``meta/server.yml.networks.local.subnet``) automatically.
        Calling ``community.docker.docker_network`` directly or
        shelling out to ``docker network create`` re-introduces the
        name/subnet drift the utils were extracted to prevent.
