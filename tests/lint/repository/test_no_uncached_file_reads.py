"""Lint guard: tests under ``tests/lint/`` MUST route file reads through
``utils.cache.files.read_text`` instead of calling ``Path.read_text(...)``
or ``Path.read_bytes(...)`` directly.

Background
==========
Pytest runs every test in one process. The lint suite alone reads the
same role/task YAML, Dockerfile, packaging spec, etc. dozens of times
across sibling tests. ``utils.cache.files.read_text`` is an LRU-cached
UTF-8 read keyed on absolute path — every duplicate scan after the
first one returns from memory. A raw ``path.read_text(...)`` call
bypasses that cache and re-reads the file from disk every time.

The cost is invisible at the call site but measurable at suite level:
each non-cached read is one ``open() + read() + decode + close()``
syscall round-trip per test that asks for it. On the lint pass alone
(20+ scanners, ~250 role trees) the wasted reads add up to seconds of
cold-cache latency that no individual test owner notices.

See ``docs/agents/action/testing.md`` for the full rule.

Scope
=====
Only ``tests/lint/`` is scanned. Lint tests are the ones that walk the
whole project tree and re-read the same files; integration/unit tests
typically read a single fixture once and gain little from the cache.

Detection
=========
AST-walks every ``.py`` file under ``tests/lint/`` and flags call
expressions matching::

    <expr>.read_text(...)
    <expr>.read_bytes(...)

The receiver is not type-inferred — every method call with that
attribute name is flagged, on the assumption that the receiver is a
``Path`` (which is the overwhelming convention in this codebase). False
positives on differently-typed receivers should opt out per call.

Plain attribute access without a call is NOT flagged. String literals,
docstrings and comments naming these methods in prose are also not
flagged because the AST sees only real call nodes.

Per-line opt-out
================
Add ``# noqa: cache-read`` (or ``# nocheck: cache-read``;
case-insensitive) on the call's own line OR, for multi-line calls, on
any line spanned by the call expression. Use this for legitimate
exceptions — e.g. reading a file from a tempdir created at runtime, a
file outside the project tree, or a synthetic fixture written and
read back inside the same test. Do NOT use it to silence the lint for
"I want the convenience of ``path.read_text()``" — replace with
``read_text(str(path))`` from ``utils.cache.files`` instead.

The marker grammar lives in
``docs/contributing/actions/testing/suppression.md``; this lint
consumes it via :func:`utils.annotations.suppress.suppressed_line_numbers`.
