r"""Lint inline shell/script blocks for size.

Ansible's ``shell:``, ``command:``, ``script:``, ``raw:`` and GitHub
Actions' ``run:`` keys all accept multi-line block scalars. Inline
scripts longer than ``MAX_LINES`` are hard to review, hard to test and
escape Ansible/GHA quoting in surprising ways — extract them into a
file under ``files/`` (or ``.github/scripts/``).

For Ansible tasks the canonical fix is the built-in ``script:`` module,
which copies the file to the target and runs it with the supplied
arguments — the task collapses to a single line:

    - script: files/sync_addon.sh "{{ var1 }}" "{{ var2 }}"

Scope
=====

Only LITERAL block scalars (``|`` / ``|-`` / ``|+``) are flagged.
FOLDED scalars (``>`` / ``>-`` / ``>+``) collapse newlines into a
single logical line in the YAML stream, so even a visually long
folded block is one shell statement and is exempt from this lint.

Counting rule
=============

Lines that end with ``\`` (line-continuation) collapse with the next
physical line and count as ONE logical line, matching how the shell
parses them. Blank lines are ignored. Comments count.

Example failure (this would fail with MAX_LINES=12):

    shell: |-
        # 13 logical lines below — extract me
        a
        b
        c
        d
        e
        f
        g
        h
        i
        j
        k
        l
