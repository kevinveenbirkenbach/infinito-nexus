# The following modes can be combined with each other
MODE_DUMMY:   false                       # Executes dummy/test routines instead of productive routines
MODE_DEBUG:   false                       # This enables debugging in ansible and in the apps, You SHOULD NOT enable this on production servers

MODE_ASSERT:  "{{ MODE_DEBUG  | bool }}"  # Executes validation tasks during the run.
MODE_BACKUP:  true                        # Executes the Backup before the deployment
