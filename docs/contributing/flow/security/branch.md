# Branch Protection 🔒

## Enforcement

* Ruleset is **Enabled (Enforced)**

👉 **Meaning for contributors:**

---

## Bypass

* Organization admins and repository admins can always bypass rules

👉 **Meaning for contributors:**

* Normal contributors MUST follow all rules
* Admins MAY merge without approvals or checks

---

## Branch Target

* Applies to: **`main` (default branch)**

👉 **Meaning for contributors:**

* All rules apply when targeting `main`.
