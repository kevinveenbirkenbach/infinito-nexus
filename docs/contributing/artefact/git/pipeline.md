# Continuous Integration 🔄

This document describes the CI pipeline structure, entry points, and gates used in Infinito.Nexus. For the catalog of every workflow file (description, triggers, inputs) see [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md).

## Overview 🗺️

CI is triggered automatically on pull-request events and on pushes to the branches listed in the entry-workflow row in [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md). The pipeline is composed of reusable workflow files under [.github/workflows/](../../../../.github/workflows/). The central coordinator is [ci-orchestrator.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/ci-orchestrator.yml), which is called by the entry workflows.

## Entry Points 🚪

Every external CI trigger MUST route through one of the entry workflows. Each entry translates its event into a call to the orchestrator; the catalog of triggers and inputs lives in [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md).

- [entry-pull-request-change.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/entry-pull-request-change.yml): detects PR scope and conditionally calls the orchestrator.
- [entry-push-latest.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/entry-push-latest.yml): calls the orchestrator for pushes on the supported branch prefixes and additionally invokes the release workflow on version tags.
- [entry-manual.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/entry-manual.yml): dispatches the orchestrator manually for a chosen distro set and whitelist.

## PR Scope Detection 🔎

Before the full pipeline runs, CI detects the scope of the PR based on the changed files and the branch prefix (see [branch.md](branch.md)).

- Documentation-only and agent-only PRs MUST pass a lightweight gate without running the full orchestrator.
- All other scopes MUST run the full [ci-orchestrator.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/ci-orchestrator.yml).
- The branch prefix MUST match the detected scope, otherwise the `validate-pr-branch-prefix` job fails.

## Pipeline Stages 🏗️

The orchestrator runs the following stages in order:

### 1. Fork Prerequisites ⏳

For fork PRs, CI waits for privileged images to be built by the `pull_request_target` event before proceeding. This ensures untrusted code never runs with elevated permissions.

### 2. Security 🛡️

The `security-codeql` job runs the CodeQL scan (catalogued in the `Security and linting` table of [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md)). A failing scan MUST fail `code-quality-gate` and thereby block all downstream deploy, install, and environment tests.

### 3. Linting 🧹

All linting workflows listed in the `Security and linting` table of [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md) run in parallel. All of them MUST pass `lint-gate` before the pipeline continues.

### 4. CI Image Build 🐳

The `build-ci-images` stage uses [images-build-ci.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/images-build-ci.yml) to build Docker images for the target distributions (`arch`, `debian`, `ubuntu`, `fedora`, `centos`). These images are consumed by all subsequent test jobs.

### 5. Code Tests 🧪

All code-test workflows listed in the `Code tests` table of [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md) run in parallel once the CI images are available. All of them MUST pass `test-code-gate`.

### 6. Code Quality Gate 🚦

The `code-quality-gate` requires linting, code tests, and security checks to all pass before deploy tests are triggered.

### 7. DNS Tests 🌐

[test-dns.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/test-dns.yml) validates DNS configuration across all target distributions.

### 8. Image Mirroring 🪞

[images-mirror-missing.yml](../../../../.github/workflows/images-mirror-missing.yml) mirrors any missing upstream images in parallel with the DNS tests so later deploy jobs pull from GHCR instead of Docker Hub, MCR, or other external registries. This shields CI from upstream rate limits, geo-blocking, and transient registry outages.

Fork PRs cannot publish mirror packages directly, so their untrusted runs wait for the trusted mirror producer before continuing. See [mirror.md](../image/mirror.md) for the mirroring architecture and naming convention.

GHCR publication uses the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN`; optional Docker Hub secrets are used only to reduce source-side Docker Hub rate limits while mirroring. See [authentication.md](../../tools/ghcr/authentication.md).

### 9. Deploy Tests 🚀

The three deploy-test workflows listed in the `Infrastructure tests` table of [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md) (server, universal, workstation scopes) run in parallel once DNS and mirroring have completed.

### 10. Installation Tests 📦

The install-test workflows listed in the `Infrastructure tests` table of [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md) run in parallel once `code-quality-gate` is green. All of them MUST pass `test-install-gate`.

### 11. Development Environment 🛠️

The `test-development` stage runs the development-environment workflow listed in the `Infrastructure tests` table of [workflows.md](../../tools/github/actions/workflows.md).

### 12. Done 🏁

The final `done` job aggregates all deploy, install, and development gates. CI is considered green only when this job succeeds.

## Concurrency 🔀

- PR pipelines use `cancel-in-progress: true` so only the newest run per PR and event type is active.
- The orchestrator uses `cancel-in-progress: false` to avoid interrupting long-running deploy tests mid-flight.
- The push entry workflow (`entry-push-latest.yml`) defaults to `cancel-in-progress: true` but respects the repository variable `CI_CANCEL_IN_PROGRESS`.

See [configuration.md](../../tools/github/actions/configuration.md) for all repository variables that control CI behaviour.

## Fork PRs 🍴

Fork PRs run under the `pull_request` event without write permissions. Privileged steps (image builds, package writes) run via `pull_request_target` after a maintainer review. The fork CI waits for those privileged images before proceeding. See [pull-request.md](pull-request.md) for the contributor-facing fork workflow.
