# LID Switch Driver
## Description

The lid switch is a hardware component on laptops that triggers power state changes (sleep, hibernate, lock) when the lid is closed. On Linux, systemd's `logind` daemon manages lid switch events via `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`. The [`setup-hibernate`](https://github.com/kevinveenbirkenbach/setup-hibernate) tool provides hibernation support configuration.
## Overview
This role addresses a common issue on Linux laptops: closing the lid while docked or plugged in leads to unintended sleep or hibernation. It installs the necessary hibernation tools and updates `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` to:
- Hibernate on lid close when on battery
- Lock the session when on AC power or docked
## Purpose
The purpose of this role is to enforce a consistent and predictable lid switch behavior across power states, improving usability on laptops that otherwise behave unpredictably when the lid is closed.
## Features
- **Installs `setup-hibernate`:** Uses `pkgmgr` to install and initialize hibernation support.
- **Systemd Integration:** Applies proper `logind.conf` settings for lid switch handling.
- **Power-aware Configuration:** Differentiates between battery, AC power, and docked state.
- **Idempotent Design:** Ensures safe re-runs and minimal unnecessary restarts.
