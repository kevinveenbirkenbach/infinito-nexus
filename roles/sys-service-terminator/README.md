# sys-service-terminator

## Description

Runs a collected list of systemd services at the **end of a play**.
This is useful for services where flush/restart is suppressed during setup,
but should be started once everything they depend on is ready.

## How it works

- Consumes `system_service_run_list` (created by `sys-service` when `system_service_force_flush_final=true`).
- Enables and starts/restarts each service.
- Shows diagnostics (`systemctl status`, `journalctl -xeu`) on failure.

## Variables

- `system_service_run_list` (list): list of systemd unit names to run
- `SYS_SERVICE_RUNNER_STATE` (string): desired state (`started`, `restarted`, ...)
