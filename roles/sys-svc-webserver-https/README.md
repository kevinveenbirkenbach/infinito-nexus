# Webserver HTTPS Provisioning ðŸš€

## Description
The **sys-svc-webserver-https** role extends a basic Nginx installation by wiring in everything you need to serve content over HTTPS:

1. Ensures your Nginx server is configured for SSL/TLS.
2. Pulls in Letâ€™s Encrypt ACME challenge handling.
3. Applies global cleanup of unused domain configs.

This role is built on top of your existing `sys-svc-webserver-core` role, and it automates the end-to-end process of turning HTTP sites into secure HTTPS sites.

---

## Overview

When you apply **sys-svc-webserver-https**, it will:

1. **Include** the `sys-svc-webserver-core` role to install and configure Nginx.  
2. **Clean up** any stale vHost files under `sys-svc-cln-domains`.  
3. **Deploy** the Letâ€™s Encrypt challenge-and-redirect snippet from `sys-svc-letsencrypt`.  
4. **Reload** Nginx automatically when any template changes.

All tasks are idempotentâ€”once your certificates are in place and your configuration is set, Ansible will skip unchanged steps on subsequent runs.
