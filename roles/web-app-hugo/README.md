# Hugo

## Description

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a fast, single-binary static site generator written in Go. This role builds a Hugo site from any upstream Git repository (default: [gohugoio/hugoDocs](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs)) at image-build time and serves the rendered HTML/CSS/JS via nginx. There is no database, no application server, and no dynamic backend at runtime.

## Overview

The role uses a multi-stage Dockerfile:

1. **Builder stage** — pinned `hugomods/hugo:exts-<version>` (extended Hugo) clones the configured content repository and runs `hugo --minify -e <env> -b <baseURL>` to render the site to `/public`.
2. **Serve stage** — pinned `nginx:<version>-alpine` ships the rendered `/public` from the builder stage as `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

`compose build` re-bakes the static output whenever the cloned content changes, so deploys are content-driven without any runtime build step.

## Configuration

The default configuration in `meta/services.yml` builds the Hugo documentation:

```yaml
hugo:
  source_repository: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs.git
  source_version:    v0.148.0
```

To host your own Hugo site, override `services.hugo.source_repository` and `services.hugo.source_version` in your inventory. Example:

```yaml
applications:
  web-app-hugo:
    services:
      hugo:
        source_repository: https://git.example.com/your-org/your-hugo-site.git
        source_version:    v1.0.0
```

The theme MUST be bundled with the source repository (either checked in under `themes/` or referenced as a Hugo Module via `go.mod`). V1 does not support a separate theme override.

## Scope

V1 supports **exactly one canonical domain** per role deploy. The play asserts this at start-up. Multi-canonical-domain support (multiple Hugo sites in one role) is a follow-up.
