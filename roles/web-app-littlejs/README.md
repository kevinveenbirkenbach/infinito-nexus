# LittleJS Playground

## Description

**LittleJS Playground** is a self-hosted web application that bundles the LittleJS engine, its official examples, and a minimal Infinito.Nexus launcher UI.  
It provides a simple, tile-based overview of demos and games, allowing you to quickly explore LittleJS examples directly in your browser.

## Overview

LittleJS Playground is designed as a lightweight HTML5 game sandbox for education, prototyping, and fun.  
It exposes the original LittleJS `examples/` browser and adds a Bootstrap-based landing page that lists all examples as clickable tiles and offers quick links to popular games such as platformers and arcade-style demos.  
The app runs as a single Docker container and requires no additional database or backend services.

## Features

- **Self-hosted LittleJS environment** — run LittleJS demos and games under your own domain.
- **Example browser integration** — direct access to the original LittleJS example browser.
- **Tile-based launcher UI** — dynamically renders a catalog from the `exampleList` definition.
- **Quick links for games** — navbar entries for selected games (e.g. platformer, pong, space shooter).
- **Bootstrap-styled interface** — clean, minimalistic, and responsive layout.
- **Docker-ready** — fully integrated into the Infinito.Nexus Docker stack.
