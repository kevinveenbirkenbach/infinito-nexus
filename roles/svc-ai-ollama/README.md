# Ollama

## Description

**Ollama** is a local model server that runs open LLMs on your hardware and exposes a simple HTTP API. It’s the backbone for privacy-first AI: prompts and data stay on your machines.

## Overview

After the first model pull, Ollama serves models to clients like Open WebUI (for chat) and Flowise (for workflows). Models are cached locally for quick reuse and can run fully offline when required.

## Features

* Run popular open models (chat, code, embeddings) locally
* Simple, predictable HTTP API for developers
* Local caching to avoid repeated downloads
* Works seamlessly with Open WebUI and Flowise
* Offline-capable for air-gapped deployments
