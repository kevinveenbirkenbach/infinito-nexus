# SSH Agent
## Description

[SSH (Secure Shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. The [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) project provides the reference implementation, including `ssh-agent` for managing authentication keys.
## Overview
This role is intended for Manjaro/Arch systems where `gnome-keyring` no longer reliably manages `ssh-agent` due to changes in behavior under Wayland. It works by deploying a `systemd --user` service, making SSH Agent integration predictable and independent of graphical environment quirks.
## Purpose
The purpose of this role is to automate the provisioning of SSH agent capabilities and synchronize the `.ssh` directory from a Git repository. This enables users to access private repositories or authenticate with remote servers immediately after login.
## Features
- **Clones a remote SSH config repository** into `~/.ssh` using the `desk-git` role.
- **Deploys and enables a systemd user service** for `ssh-agent`.
- **Ensures environment compatibility** by injecting the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` variable into either `.bash_profile` or `.profile`.
- **Fails gracefully** with an optional debug message if the Git repository is unreachable.
- **KeePassXC ready**: Ensures compatibility with password managers that support SSH agent integration.
