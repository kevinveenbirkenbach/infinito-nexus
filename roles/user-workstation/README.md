# Workstation User

## Description

This role creates the workstation user defined by *WORKSTATION_USER* and configures
its basic environment. It integrates with the shared `user` role to deploy shell
dotfiles and SSH `authorized_keys`.

## Single Point of Truth (SPOT)

User data must be defined under `users.<name>` and selected via `WORKSTATION_USER`.

Minimum required fields:
- `WORKSTATION_USER`
- `users.<WORKSTATION_USER>.username` (defaults to WORKSTATION_USER if missing)

Optional fields:
- `users.<WORKSTATION_USER>.uid`
- `users.<WORKSTATION_USER>.gid`
- `users.<WORKSTATION_USER>.shell`
- `users.<WORKSTATION_USER>.groups` (list)
- `users.<WORKSTATION_USER>.authorized_keys` (list; may be empty)

## Notes

- Sudo can be enabled via `user_workstation_enable_sudo`.
- Password handling is intentionally conservative. If you want a password, set
  `users.<WORKSTATION_USER>.password` (plain) and enable `user_workstation_set_password`.
