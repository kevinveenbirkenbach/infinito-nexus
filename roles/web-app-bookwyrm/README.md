# BookWyrm

## Description

**BookWyrm** is a self-hosted social reading platform where users can share books, post reviews, follow each other, and join federated conversations across the Fediverse. It is a community-driven alternative to proprietary platforms like Goodreads. Readers can catalog their library, track reading progress, and discover new books through friends and federated timelines.

## Overview

BookWyrm provides a federated social network for books built on ActivityPub. Each instance can be private, invitation-only, or open for public registration. Users can import/export book lists, interact with others across the Fediverse, and maintain their own curated reading environment. As an admin, you can configure moderation tools, content rules, and federation policies to suit your community.

## Features

- **Federated Social Network:** Connects with other BookWyrm instances and ActivityPub platforms.
- **Book Cataloging:** Add, search, and organize books; import/export libraries.
- **Reading Status & Reviews:** Mark books as “to read,” “reading,” or “finished,” and publish reviews or quotes.
- **Timelines & Interaction:** Follow other readers, comment on reviews, and engage in federated discussions.
- **Privacy & Moderation:** Fine-grained controls for content visibility, moderation, and federation settings.
- **Community Building:** Host a private club, classroom library, or large public community for readers.
- **Optional SSO Integration:** Can work with OIDC for unified login across platforms.
