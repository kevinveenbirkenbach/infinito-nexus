# NGINX Certbot Automation

## 🔥 Description

This role automates the setup of an automatic [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate renewal system for NGINX using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). It ensures that SSL/TLS certificates are renewed seamlessly in the background and that NGINX reloads automatically after successful renewals.

## 📖 Overview

Optimized for Archlinux systems, this role installs the `certbot-NGINX` package, configures a dedicated `systemd` service for certificate renewal, and integrates with a `sys-timer` to schedule periodic renewals. After a renewal, NGINX is reloaded to apply the updated certificates immediately.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Renewal:** Schedules unattended certificate renewals using sys-timers.
- **Seamless NGINX Reload:** Reloads the NGINX service automatically after successful renewals.
- **Systemd Integration:** Manages renewal operations reliably with `systemd` and `sys-ctl-alm-compose`.
- **Quiet and Safe Operation:** Uses `--quiet` and `--agree-tos` flags to ensure non-interactive renewals.

## 🎯 Purpose

The NGINX Certbot Automation role ensures that Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates stay valid without manual intervention. It enhances the security and reliability of web services by automating certificate lifecycle management.

## 🚀 Features

- **Certbot-NGINX Package Installation:** Installs required certbot plugins for NGINX.
- **Custom Systemd Service:** Configures a lightweight, dedicated renewal service.
- **Timer Setup:** Uses sys-timer to run certbot renewals periodically.
- **Failure Notification:** Integrated with `sys-ctl-alm-compose` for alerting on failures.
