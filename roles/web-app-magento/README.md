# Magento

## Description

**Magento (Adobe Commerce Open Source)** is a powerful, extensible e-commerce platform built with PHP. It supports multi-store setups, advanced catalog management, promotions, checkout flows, and a rich extension ecosystem.

## Overview

This role deploys **Magento 2** via Docker Compose. It is aligned with the Infinito.Nexus stack patterns:
- Reverse-proxy integration (front proxy handled by platform roles)
- Optional **central database** (MariaDB) or app-local DB
- **OpenSearch** for catalog search (required by Magento 2.4+)
- Optional **Redis** cache/session (can be toggled)
- Health checks, volumes, and environment templating
- SMTP wired via platform's `SYSTEM_EMAIL` settings

For setup & operations, see:
- [Installation.md](./Installation.md)
- [Administration.md](./Administration.md)
- [Upgrade.md](./Upgrade.md)
- [User_Administration.md](./User_Administration.md)

## Features

- **Modern search:** OpenSearch out of the box (single-node).
- **Flexible DB:** Use platform's central MariaDB or app-local DB.
- **Optional Redis:** Toggle cache/session backend.
- **Proxy-aware:** Exposes HTTP on localhost, picked up by front proxy role.
- **Automation-friendly:** Admin user seeded from inventory variables.
