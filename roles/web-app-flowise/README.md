# Flowise

## Description

**Flowise** is a visual builder for AI workflows. Create, test, and publish chains that combine LLMs, your documents, tools, and vector search—without writing glue code.

## Overview

Users design flows on a drag-and-drop canvas (LLM, RAG, tools, webhooks), test them interactively, and publish endpoints that applications or bots can call. Flowise works well with local backends such as **Ollama** (directly or via **LiteLLM**) and **Qdrant** for retrieval.

## Features

* No/low-code canvas to build assistants and pipelines
* Publish flows as HTTP endpoints for easy integration
* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with vector DBs (e.g., Qdrant)
* Pluggable model backends via OpenAI-compatible API or direct Ollama
* Keep data and prompts on your own infrastructure
