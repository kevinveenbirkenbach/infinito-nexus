# Bridgy Fed

## Description
Bridgy Fed bridges ActivityPub (Fediverse), ATProto/Bluesky, and IndieWeb (webmentions/mf2). It mirrors identities and interactions across networks.

## Overview
This role builds and runs Bridgy Fed as a Docker container and (optionally) starts a Datastore-mode Firestore emulator as a sidecar. It exposes HTTP locally for a front proxy.

Upstream docs & dev notes:
- User & developer docs: https://fed.brid.gy and https://bridgy-fed.readthedocs.io/
- Source: https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed
- Local run (reference): `flask run -p 8080` with BRIDGY_APPVIEW_HOST/BRIDGY_PLC_HOST/BRIDGY_BGS_HOST/BRIDGY_PDS_HOST set, and Datastore emulator envs

## Features
- Dockerized Flask app (gunicorn)
- Optional Firestore emulator (Datastore mode) sidecar
- Front proxy integration via `sys-stk-front-proxy`

## Quick start
1) Set domains and ports in inventory.  
2) Enable/disable the emulator in `config/main.yml`.  
3) Run the role; your front proxy will publish the app.

## Notes
- Emulator is **not** for production; itâ€™s in-memory unless you mount a volume/configure import/export.
