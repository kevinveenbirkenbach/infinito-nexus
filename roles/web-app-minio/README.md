# MinIO

## Description

**MinIO** is an S3-compatible object storage service for files, media, backups, and AI artifacts—self-hosted for performance and control.

## Overview

Applications that speak “S3” (Pixelfed, Mastodon, Nextcloud, Flowise, etc.) store and retrieve objects from MinIO buckets using familiar SDKs and CLIs. Admins manage buckets, users, and access policies through a browser console while keeping everything on-prem.

## Features

* S3-compatible API for broad app compatibility
* Buckets, users, access keys, and fine-grained policies
* Optional versioning, lifecycle rules, and object lock
* Presigned URLs for secure, time-limited uploads/downloads
* Ideal for AI stacks: datasets, embeddings, and artifacts
